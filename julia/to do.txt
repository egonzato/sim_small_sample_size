to do: check availability of all functions needed

simulate continuous, binary and time to event data, done
cox model, done (has also robust variance estimator and allows for weights)
predictions on cox model, done (written function)

matching procedure:
ps matching (no function, need to write on my own)
template matching 
ipw (done, written function)
g-comp (done, written function)
tmle (there is no function available, decide what to do)


try simulation with two methods to see speed of software and compare with R


priorities:
- gcomp function, with bootstrap (done)
- ps matching (identical to R)
- simulate two methods
- template matching
